Fires in Portugal 
======


## The problem

In Portugal, every year we have a problem with fires. Most of the time it's due either to poor resource allocation, or insufficient resources. I try to understand if it's possible to create a model to predict with acceptable accuracy the burnt area. In the process of cleaning and studying the dataset, I found many interesting things that are explained in the presentation. Feel free to use everything on this repository for your projects.

I will develop this continuously and feed it with new data.

### Folders list
