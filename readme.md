## Fires in Portugal 

# The problem

In portugal, every year we have a problem with fires. Most of the times it's due either to poor resources allocation, or insuficient resources.
I try to understand if it's possible to create a model to predict with acceptable accuracy the burnt area.
In the process of cleaning and studying  the dataset i found out many interesting things that are explained in the presentation.
Feel fre to use everything on this repository for your projects

I will develop this continuously and feed it with new data.
